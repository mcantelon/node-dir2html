node-directory-view
-------------------

Node-directory-view is a Javascript class that uses node.js to read a directory
and render it to HTML.

Directories can be set to be "closed" by default or "open". Children of "open"
directories will be rendered.

The example shows the use of a session variable (sessions implemented using
another project) to toggle the "closed"/"open" states of individual
directories.

The example requires Connect for session support:

Run:
# node example.js
